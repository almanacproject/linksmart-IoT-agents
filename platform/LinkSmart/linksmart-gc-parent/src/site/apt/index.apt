Welcome to LinkSmart

  LinkSmart is an OSGi-based middleware for the networking of heterogeneous systems through loosely coupled web services. 
  Our vision is to build an interoperability platform that facilitates the creation of cost-effective, 
  high-performance cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications.
  LinkSmart was originally developed within the {{{http://hydramiddleware.eu/}Hydra}}
  EU project for Networked Embedded Systems, allowing developers to incorporate heterogeneous 
  physical devices into their applications through easy-to-use web services for controlling any device.
